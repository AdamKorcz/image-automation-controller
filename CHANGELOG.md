# Changelog

## 0.2.0

**Release date:** 2021-01-06

This prerelease comes with a fix to the manifest update
mechanism. The controller now only writes files that were
actually updated by an image policy setter instead of 
reformatting all Kubernetes YAMLs.

Starting with this version, the `spec.checkout.branch`
field is mandatory.

Fixes:
* Screen files, and output only those updated
  [#73](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/73)

Improvements:
* Record last pushed commit in status
  [#75](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/75)
* Make the branch field mandatory
  [#74](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/74)

## 0.1.0

**Release date:** 2020-12-10

This is the first _prerelease_ of image-automation-controller and its
API. The controller watches ImagePolicy objects (as in the
[image-reflector-controller API][imagev1]) and commits updates to
files in git when the "latest image" changes.

The controller and API conform to the GitOps Toolkit conventions, and
will work with the `flux` CLI, and dashboards using the standard
metrics, and so on.

This release supports:

 - updating YAML files with image refs, names or tags according to
   [markers you add][marker-example] in the YAML.
 - supplying a custom commit message
